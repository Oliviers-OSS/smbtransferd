smbtransferd
============

Small daemon which monitor a subtree and send files in this subtree using the SMB/CIFS protocol (thanks to the SMB client library from the SAMBA project) to a remote computer. 
It can be managed using its CORBA interface and a small use convention allows performing transactional transfers.
